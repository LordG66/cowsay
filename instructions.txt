Jenkins Task 2
Versioned Cowsay 
----------------
This is a Jenkins Classic exercise. 
In this exercise you are required to create a "Release" Job for an "on-prem" application.
The first part will create a manually triggered job, and after that it will be git triggered.

Instructions:
-------------
- create a manual jenkins job that accepts version parameter (e.g. 1.2)
- write script for the job that:

  If branch release/{x.y} does not exist:
      - creates the branch from latest master
      - updates version.txt to reflect the branch "x.y"
      - pushes the branch, with new version.txt
If branch release/{x.y} does exist:
  pull sources and checkout release/{x.y}
  calculate and set a 3-number version in version.txt
  build
  test the release
  push to Docker-Hub using the release as the image tag 
  git clean & git tag & git push tag


Create another job that uses script to release automatically on any commit for branch release/{v}
The release will make a “Deployment” to your local machine
